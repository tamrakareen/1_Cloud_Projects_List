# Host a Static Website using AWS Amplify in the AWS Console

## Introduction

Static websites deliver HTML, JavaScript, images, video and other files to your website visitors. Static websites are very low cost, provide high-levels of reliability, require almost no IT administration, and scale to handle enterprise-level traffic with no additional work.

AWS Amplify provides fully managed hosting for static websites and web apps. Amplify’s hosting solution leverages Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3 to deliver your site assets via the AWS content delivery network (CDN).

Amplify offers a Git-based workflow with continuous deployment, allowing you to automatically deploy updates to your site on every code commit.

## Prerequisite

You'll need to set up the following for this project:
- AWS account

### Step 1 — Create and Connect Repository

I used GitHub to create a repository.

I forgot to click on add a Read Me file, so I created one on Git Bash.
