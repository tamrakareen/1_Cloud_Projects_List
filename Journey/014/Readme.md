Deploying a VM in AWS using Terraform Workflow

## Introduction

I completed an A Cloud Guru certification in foundations of Terraform. It's time to get some projects in Terraform done! I started with a basic practicioner level project creating an AWS EC2 from the Terraform terminal.

## Prerequisite

A Cloud Guru Account OR AWS account AND Terraform 

## Cloud Research

When I started this project, I wanted to install Terraform and use my own AWS account, but Terraform was not installing correctly on my windows laptop.  I used powershell to install Chocolatey and install terraform that way, but still no luck.  Thankfully I have access to A Cloud Guru's playgound and can use their instant terminals. I have to admit I got a little carried away installing Chocolatey software packages. 

### Step 1 — Understanding The Core Terraform Workflow

Write, Plan, Apply.

Write- Create your Terraform code
Plan- Add and review changes to code
Apply- Deploy infrastructure

### Step 2 — (Write) Create a Directory and Write Your Terraform Code

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

✍️ I liked this project, it was simple and jogged my memory of learning Terraform. This would be a really fast process if I had to spin up a bunch of vm's.

## Next Steps

Next I'd like to build and test a Terraform module
